# Recylable-packaging-return-system-for-Ecommerce

This report discusses the theoretical potential of establishing a Deposit Refund System (DRS) for the e-commerce industry, analyzing the critical assumptions and pre-requisites of such an endeavor, and making general recommendation based on the research. There exists an observable trend towards circular supply chains across industries, and the authors’ fundamental assumption in this project is that DRS’, regardless of their executor, is a holistically beneficial solution to leverage that trend. Therefore, also considering the scale of this novel idea, this paper presents an exploratory ‘pilot study’ on the topic, and deliberately does not attempt to synthesize a monetizable idea or a business plan explicitly, but rather contribute grounds for expanded future research in the area. With that caveat, the intended audience for the paper should be SC practitioners and academics in general, policymakers, and the current circular SC ecosystem of non-profits/governmental organizations.
